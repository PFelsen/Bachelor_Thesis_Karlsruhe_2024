Changelog for version 5.1
--------------

* visit us on github.com/ORNL/TASMANIAN

* added functionality to access hierarchical functions and coefficients
  which allows constructing model approximation from an arbitrary
  cloud of samples, as opposed to requiring the use of the specific
  points in the hypercube

* added custom CUDA kernels for evaluations for LocalPolynomial grids,
  both sparse/dense basis of hierarchical functions and batch evaluations
  can be performed with the CUDA kernels for extra speed.
  evaluateFast for LocalPolynomial also benefits from acceleration

* grids can be written/read in either binary or ascii format,
  MATLAB defaults to binary format now

* CUDA accelerated evaluations can be triggered from MATLAB,
  just specify `lGrid.gpuDevice = X,` where X is a valid CUDA device
  run `tsgCoreTests()` to see a list of the available devices

* added tsgCoreTests() script to MATLAB

* added tweaks and simplifications to the build system,
  the main options remain the same, but check the manual for changes
  to the additional options

* added Fortran 90/95 interface (still very EXPERIMENTAL)

* significantly expanded the automated testing procedures and code
  coverage

* numerous bug fixes and performance enhancements
